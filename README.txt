Features
========

This package provides:

- Functions to get Unicode Character Database (UCD) properties concerned with text segmentations.
- Functions to determin segmentation boundaries of Unicode strings.
- Classes that help implement Unicode-aware text wrapping on both console (monospace) and graphical (monospace / propotional) font environments.

Supporting segmentations are:

*code point*
    `Code point <http://www.unicode.org/glossary/#code_point>`_ is *"any value in the Unicode codespace."* It is the basic unit for processing Unicode strings.
*grapheme cluster*
    `Grapheme cluster <http://www.unicode.org/glossary/#grapheme_cluster>`_ approximately represents *"user-perceived character."* They may be made up of single or multiple Unicode code points. e.g. "G" + *acute-accent* is a *user-perceived character*.
*word break*
    Word boundaries are familiar segmentation in many common text operations. e.g. Unit for text highlighting, cursor jumping etc. Note that *words* are not determinable only by spaces or punctuations in text in some languages. Such languages like Thai or Japanese require dictionaries to determine appropriate word boundaries. Though the package only provides simple word breaking implementation which is based on the scripts and doesn't use any dictionaires, it also provides ways to customize its default behaviours.
*sentensce break*
    Sentence breaks are also common in text processing but they are more contextual and less formal. The sentence breaking implementation (which is specified in UAX: Unicode Standard Annex) in the package is simple and formal too. But it must be still useful in some usages.
*line break*
    Implementing line breaking algorithm is one of the key features of this package. The feature is important in many general text presentations in both CLI and GUI applications.

`PyICU <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/PyICU>`_ - Python extension wrapping the ICU C++ API
    *PyICU* is a Python extension wrapping International Components for Unicode library (ICU). It also provides text segmentation supports and they just perform richer and faster than those of ours. PyICU is an extension library so it requires ICU dynamic library (binary files) and compiler to build the extention. Our package is written in pure Python; it runs slower but is more portable.
`pytextseg <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pytextseg>`_ - Python module for text segmentation
    *pytextseg* package forcuses very similar goal to ours; it provides Unicode-aware text wrapping features. They designed and uses their original string class (not built-in ``unicode`` / ``str`` classes) for the purpose. We use strings as just ordinary built-in ``unicode`` / ``str`` objects for text processing in our modules.
